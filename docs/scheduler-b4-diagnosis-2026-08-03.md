# B4 — prod scheduler not running: code audit + candidate causes

**Date:** 2026-08-03 · **Status:** open (nothing in this repo needs changing) · **Access:** written from a code audit only — no Coolify or prod access from this session, so the remaining diagnosis is one look at the scheduler resource's logs.

Companion to [`prod-e2e-findings-2026-07-24.md`](prod-e2e-findings-2026-07-24.md) §B4, which established the symptom. This doc records what has now been **ruled out**, the causes still standing, and how to tell them apart — so nobody re-audits the image again.

## The symptom (from the 2026-07-24 run)

A HOLD queue entry with `generateAt` 10 minutes in the past was created (201, PENDING) and polled for **185s** — three worker poll cycles. It stayed **PENDING**, `retryCount: 0`, no draft, no `errorReason`. The app resource was demonstrably redeployed at the time.

`retryCount: 0` with no error is the load-bearing detail: a claimed-then-failed job would have incremented it and written `errorReason`. The entry was **never claimed**, which means no process executed the claim UPDATE at all.

## Ruled out — verified in the repo at `main` (2026-08-03)

Do not re-audit these; all four are correct:

| Concern                             | Verified                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| ----------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| The worker is actually in the image | `Dockerfile:52-57` bundles `src/scheduler/worker.ts` → `dist/scheduler/worker.js` via esbuild (`@prisma/client` external); `Dockerfile:109` copies `dist/` into the runner stage                                                                                                                                             |
| The CMD override still migrates     | `Dockerfile:127` sets `ENTRYPOINT ["/app/docker-entrypoint.sh"]` and `:131` leaves `CMD ["node","server.js"]`; `docker-compose.yml:22` overrides **`command:` only**, so the scheduler boots through the same migrating entrypoint (`docker-entrypoint.sh` — advisory-locked `migrate deploy`, then `exec "$@"`)             |
| CI redeploys the scheduler          | `.github/workflows/docker-publish.yml:64-68` calls the Coolify deploy API for UUID `warr96qhvzrie5ndwv8oteeu` after the GHCR push, alongside the app's `nck8s530pseqdcfxt50hndl5`                                                                                                                                            |
| The worker polls correctly          | `src/scheduler/worker.ts` runs `runScheduledJobs` + `runGenerationJobs` as two independent 60s loops, each with a per-tick catch (a DB hiccup can't kill the process); `src/lib/scheduler/generationRunner.ts:26-42` claims `PENDING AND generateAt <= now()` with `FOR UPDATE SKIP LOCKED` — correct for the observed entry |

So there is **no code or image defect behind B4**. It is a Coolify resource-configuration problem.

## Candidate causes, and how to tell which

One look at the **scheduler** resource's container logs in Coolify decides it. Each cause prints something distinct on boot:

| Logs show                                                                          | Cause                                                                                                                                                                       | Fix                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `▲ Next.js` / listening on port 3000                                               | **Start command not overridden** — the resource runs the default `CMD` (`node server.js`), so it is a second copy of the web app: deploys green, serves HTTP, polls nothing | Set the resource's **Start Command** to `node dist/scheduler/worker.js`. It must replace the **command**, not the entrypoint — overriding the entrypoint would also skip `migrate deploy` |
| `[scheduler] starting, poll interval: 60000 ms`                                    | The worker **is** running → it is pointed at a different database (own env set, or a stale `DATABASE_URL`)                                                                  | Make `DATABASE_URL` byte-identical to the app resource's; the whole `.env` should match                                                                                                   |
| `[entrypoint] applying pending Prisma migrations…` followed by an error, repeating | **Crash-loop.** `docker-entrypoint.sh` runs under `set -e`, so a failed `migrate deploy` exits before the worker ever starts                                                | Fix the failing migration / DB permissions. `SKIP_MIGRATIONS=1` on the resource is the emergency boot                                                                                     |
| Nothing at all                                                                     | Resource stopped, or was never created                                                                                                                                      | Start it, or create it from the same image + `.env` with the start command above                                                                                                          |

**Most likely: the first row.** It is the only cause that reports a _successful_ deploy while doing no work, which is what the 2026-07-24 run observed (webhook fired, app resource verifiably updated, no worker activity).

## Second blocker — independent of the above

Even a correctly running worker fails every scheduled job today:

- Scheduled runs call `withClaudeAuth(null, teamId, …)` (`src/lib/scheduler/generationRunner.ts:145`). `userId: null` is deliberate — an unattended run has no acting teammate — so there is **no personal-token tier**, only the team's.
- Neither prod team (Bistec, Hearts Academy) has `Team.encryptedClaudeToken` set (`/api/team/claude-token` → `{connected:false}`, checked 2026-07-27).

Result: a no-credential `ClaudeCliError` per job, caught by the retry path (`generationRunner.ts:165-195`) → 3 retries at 20/40/60-min backoff → `FAILED` about two hours later. **Fixing the Coolify resource alone converts "nothing happens" into "fails slowly".** Set a team Claude token at `/team` for both teams first.

The worker already reports this on startup: `logTeamsWithoutClaudeToken()` (`worker.ts:29-48`) logs every team with no token — a useful second confirmation that the logs you are reading belong to a real worker.

## Adjacent, non-blocking

Both prod IMAGE providers are `isEnabled: true` but `isDefault: false`. `resolveImageProvider` tier 3 requires `isDefault`, and an unattended run has no personal tier — so scheduled generations will complete but with **no AI background** (design falls back to CSS/SVG; it never throws). Mark the IMAGE row default on each team.

## Verification, once both are fixed

1. Scheduler resource logs show `[scheduler] starting, poll interval: 60000 ms`.
2. Create a HOLD queue entry with `generateAt` in the past on a campaign.
3. Within 60s it moves `PENDING → RUNNING`; a full CLI-mode generation is ~5 min (copy ≤120s + background ≤90s + design ≤300s, lease 15 min).
4. It ends `COMPLETED` with a draft. On failure, the queue table shows `errorReason` (`ScheduledQueueSection.tsx:131`).
5. Then the kept Claude Testing test data can be wiped (see the 2026-07-24 findings) — **not** the Hearts Academy prod data.

## Recommended hardening — not built

B4's real cost was not that the scheduler stopped; it is that it stopped **invisibly for ~11 days**, and was found only by watching a queue row fail to change for 185 seconds. Three changes would make it self-reporting:

1. **Heartbeat** — a `WorkerHeartbeat` row per loop (`publish`, `generation`), upserted with `lastTickAt` on every tick. One migration.
2. **Surface it** — a banner on the campaign queue panel when the newest tick is older than ~3 minutes: _"Scheduler offline — planned posts will not generate."_ Converts silent nothing into a stated fault, and gives a definitive green light after a Coolify change instead of an inferred one.
3. **Show `errorReason` while retrying, not only on `FAILED`** — `ScheduledQueueSection.tsx:131` gates the message on `status === 'FAILED'`, so an entry backing off for 20/40/60 min looks like an ordinary `PENDING` with no indication that a credential error already occurred.

Scope: one migration, one read route, a small UI change, plus a pure staleness helper with unit tests. None of it unblocks scheduled generation by itself — the Coolify resource and the team tokens are the fix — but it makes the next regression announce itself.
