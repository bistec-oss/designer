// CLI mode (prod fix 2026-07-23): copy generation defaults to the local Claude
// CLI, billed via the OAuth chain (personal UserClaudeToken -> team token) —
// no registered COPY provider row is required. So the wizard need not send a
// copyProviderKey; when it's omitted we store the self-documenting 'cli' marker
// and skip the existence check (resolveCopyProvider treats it as the CLI default,
// and it also matches a legacy seeded 'cli' provider row where one exists).
//
// An explicitly provided key OVERRIDES and is existence-checked by the route.
// API mode still requires a key (there is no OAuth fallback outside CLI mode).

// stopped matching the route when CLI mode made the key optional. The Generate
// button stayed disabled and the API's CLI default was unreachable from the UI —
// the fix was server-side only. Sharing one function makes that drift
// impossible: if the route would accept the submission, the button is live.
